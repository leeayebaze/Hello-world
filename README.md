It is pretty easy to add a collaborator to a free plan.

Navigate to the repository on Github you wish to share with your collaborator.
Click on the "Settings" tab on the right side of the menu at the top of the screen.
On the new page, click the "Collaborators" menu item on the left side of the page.
Start typing the new collaborator's GitHub username into the text box.
Select the GitHub user from the list that appears below the text box.
Click the "Add" button.
The added user should now be able to push to your repository on GitHub.
